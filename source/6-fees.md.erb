# Fees
## Investment
Our fees are always based upon the project and not upon time units. That way you’re encourage to call upon us without worrying about a meter running, and we’re free to suggest additional areas of focus without concern about increasing your investment.

The fee for the assistance detailed above will be **<%= data.proposal.proposal_price %>**.

## Payment Terms
Invoices will be submitted electronically, to <%= data.client.client_email %> (or an email address you designate). Invoices are due within 5 days of submission. Failure to pay invoices in a timely manner will result in the cessation of work.  

For this project, the payment schedule will be as follows:

* Invoice 1 will be due on <%= (Date.parse(data.proposal.proposal_date) + 7).strftime("%B %e, %Y") %>, in order to retain us
* Invoice 2 will be due upon completion of Milestone 3
* Invoice 3 will be due upon completion of the project (anticipated <%= (Date.parse(data.proposal.end_date) + 7).strftime("%B %e, %Y") %>)
